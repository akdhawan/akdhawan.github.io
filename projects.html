						The Rubiks Cube Solver was my final project for CS107e: Computer Systems from the Ground Up. The class is taught in bare metal C. The final project was of our own choosing where we were supposed to consolidate our knowledge of key concepts and make something relatively creative. I decided to build a robot capable of solving a Rubiks Cube. The bulk of the design was done in Solidworks while the software was written in baremetal C.

						The Mechanical Selector was a project for ME102: Foundations of Project Realization where the goal was to utilize user input to mechanically select an output. I stored user inputted energy using a spring attached to a string. A ratchet and pinion mechanism was used to store rotational energy and convert it into a random output. This project was designed in Solidworks and brough to fruition using a lasercutter.

						For this project, I developed a device capablle of recognizing objects for visually impaired people and guiding them to those objects via auditory resposes. The device utilized voice recognition, object detection, computer vision, object recognition, and depth perception to locate objects in a room and guide the user to those objects. I filed patent for a device but was unable to <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20160260353A1/en"> patent </a> because a similar technology patent was filed by toyota a few months prior.

						For this project, I developed  a device capable of recognizing various types of distracted driving behaviors (cognitive, visual, and manual) in a vehicle in motion and alerting the driver and potentially others of the risk at hand. This device utilized a combination of open source devices. I filed <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20170210289A1/en?oq=15%2f257%2c153"> patent </a> for this device which is still in process.

						For this project, I investigated the possibility of breaking a tetrahydrofuran methanol azeotrope using carbon nanoparticles and light waves rather than temperature and pressure. I obtained a research credit at University of Southern Indiana through this project with Prof. Jeffery Seyler.

					<p class = "description differentLineSpacing">
						For this project, I equipped a wheel to harness energy from the wheel in motion and store it in a form for use in 3rd world contries where access to light is scarce. I utilized piezoelectric sensors, coils and magnets (Faraday's Law), and Super Capacitors to do this. Super Capicators were used as the main storage method since they are easily recharagable, can hold charge for a long period of time, and can be cycled thousands of times.

					<p class = "description shortLineSpacin">
						For this project, I equipped a white cane with sensors to virtually extend the cane. Visually impaired individuals utilize the white cane to navigate and move from place to place. Their main limitation is the length of the cane as it typically limited to around 4 feet. It would be useful to extend the cane to 10ft, but the impracticality of physically extending a white cane to 10ft makes it impossible. As a result, I equipped the white cane with ultrasonic sensors to virtually extend the cane and alert the visually impaired person to the presense of an object via an auditory response.
